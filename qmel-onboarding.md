# Welcome to the Quantitative Marine Ecology Lab!

Welcome to the Quantitative Marine Ecology Lab (QMEL) at UNH. You are
joining a team of scientists dedicated to changing the world by tackling
the most pressing problems in ecology. We use a variety of quantitative
approaches, coupled with big data and experiments, to investigate the
natural world, with a focus on marine systems. The purpose of this
document is to help ensure a more seamless transition into the lab. The
document is a living document and is by no means exhaustive. The goal is
simply to try and get members of the lab on the same page and to help
you be successful. You are encouraged to make additions and edits to
this document in order to help future lab members. In addition, to this
lab manual, there is also a [**lab
wiki**](https://github.com/QuantMarineEcoLab/lab-onboarding/wiki). The
lab wiki is to provide more nitty gritty details on how the lab operates
and how to be successful (e.g., how to get signed off to operate UNH
boats, where to find funding, etc.). The
[wiki](https://github.com/QuantMarineEcoLab/lab-onboarding/wiki) is in
the same repository as this onboarding document.

As a new member of the lab, you will be expected to read through this
manual. This lab manual is only a starting point for how the lab
operates. Ultimately, the lab is made of people. We as a lab determine
the environment in which we all work.

Wherever possible, this document includes links to other resources and
documents on campus. This is to reduce overlap in effort and to keep
everything up to date. Here are two of the most important:

-   UNH Graduate School:
    <https://unh.app.box.com/s/za4ndpjqa9x0dzxi7yljnr8eqq4njbj2>
-   DBS Grad Student Handbook:

PI or a trainee in a different lab and want to write your own lab
manual, feel free to take inspiration from this one (and cite us!)

# Guiding principles

There are several guiding principles that form the basis of my outlook
as a scientist which also inform my approach to leading a lab.
Throughout this lab manual, I will come back to these themes.

1.  Work-life balance
2.  Vulnerability and openness
3.  Transparency
4.  Tracking progress
5.  Antiracist principles
6.  Embrace failure - failing often is the key to success
7.  Celebrate and support one another
8.  Produce high quality science
9.  Communicate early and often
10. Backwards design
11. Produce science that can be used (stakeholder engagement, popular
    press)

# General expectations

## Big picture

Science can be hard, frustrating, and even sometimes painful (like when
my appendix ruptured in the field!). However, the process of science can
also be filled with joy, discovery, and collaboration. As a lab, it is
key that we work together to create an environment that is conducive to
productive, honest, and healthy science. We do not buy into [myths that
one has to work 80 hours a
week](https://dynamicecology.wordpress.com/2014/02/04/you-do-not-need-to-work-80-hours-a-week-to-succeed-in-academia/)
or that you have to be cutthroat to succeed. With that in mind, there
are a few big picture thoughts that are important for this lab (many of
which are very different from other labs you may have been a part of):

-   You should be working on problems that excite you. This doesn’t mean
    every step of the process will be exciting, but following your
    curiosity is a tried-and-true path to creating interesting and
    impactful science.
-   We have to be very careful and honest about the science we produce.
    I am not a famous PI at some fancy school. When we produce
    groundbreaking or novel work, people will not take our word for it
    (and nor should they!). We have to be sure of the work we produce
    and own up to mistakes when they happen.
-   Some of science is done on an individual business, but it is also
    highly collaborative. This is especially true in QMEL. When someone
    in the lab succeeds, we all succeed. Be kind and help one another.
-   If you are struggling professionally or personally, it is important
    to seek help. This can be from Easton, your fellow lab mates,
    friends, family, or professionals. Easton sees a therapist
    frequently as a check on his mental health.
-   A research lab is similar to a small business. As the lab PI, I am
    the entrepreneur and CEO. One of my main responsibilities is to
    provide overall direction and to bring in work (via grants).
    However, because we are a small group, there should be a relatively
    flat hierarchy in the lab. This research lab will only be successful
    if we work together.
-   Research funding and publications are two commonly used metrics of
    success in science. This is problematic in many ways, but it is how
    things are. This doesn’t mean that we can’t work on other things
    (e.g., science outreach), but funding and publications still have to
    happen.
-   Each semester, we will reflect as a group and in one-on-one
    discussions on upcoming goals of the lab. This is meant as a way to
    track our progress towards goals and reduce ambiguity. We are not
    aiming to accomplish 100% of our goals. Ideally, we will only
    accomplish 70-80% of our goals each semester to ensure our goals are
    achievable, but lofty. We also keep the idea of backwards design in
    our planning process on order to help us achieve our long-term
    goals.
-   A critical part of being a lab member is attending events in the
    department, on campus, and beyond the university. Events can include
    casual coffee breaks, job candidate talks, scientific lectures, and
    social hours. All of these events provide an important opportunity
    for both your own career and to build a culture of community.

## Small picture

-   If you’re sick, stay home and take care of yourself. Because you
    need it, and also because others don’t need to get sick.
-   You aren’t expected to come into lab on weekends and holidays, and
    you aren’t expected to stay late at night (Easton rarely works
    during these times). You are expected to get your work done
    (whatever time of day you like to do it).
-   Show up and be on time for meetings.
-   Keep the lab spaces clean and tidy

## Taking time off

In order to maintain your mental health and productivity, it is
essential to take time off. For this reason, all full-time lab members,
including the PI, are guaranteed 20 paid days off. The lab PI
appreciates when you let him know you won’t be in, but you are welcome
to take time off for any reason. You don’t need to take time off for a
scientific conference (related to your graduate work) or for holidays.
There is no need to formally track your time off. There may also be days
where your work isn’t going particularly well. You should feel empowered
to leave work early and take care of yourself. In this lab, we are
worried about long-term productivity versus how much time you spend on
any given day doing work.

# Expectations of the Principal Investigator

Including the expectations above and throughout this document, I promise
to:

-   Support you (scientifically, emotionally, financially)
-   Give you feedback on a timely basis, including feedback on project
    ideas, conference posters, talks, manuscripts, figures, grants
-   Be available in person and via online on a regular basis, including
    regular meetings to discuss your research (and anything else you’d
    like to discuss)
-   Give my perspective on where the lab is going, where the field is
    going, and tips about surviving and thriving in academia
-   Support your career development by introducing you to other
    researchers in the field, promoting your work at talks, writing
    recommendation letters for you, and letting you attend conferences
    as often as finances permit
-   Help you prepare for the next step of your career, whether it’s a
    post-doc, a faculty job, or a job outside of academia
-   Care for your emotional and physical well-being, and prioritize that
    above all else

# Communication

One of the most important aspects to being successful in this lab, UNH,
and elsewhere is clear, early, and frequent communication. Early
communication can save everyone a lot of headaches later on. We have
several platforms for communication.

## Weekly lab meetings

Each week, we will meet as an entire lab. At the beginning of each
semester, we will decide on lab meeting objectives and goals. This can
include topics like professional development, practice talks, reading
and discussing papers, general check ins (including our mental health),
or collaborative lab projects.

## Weekly one-on-one meetings

I (Easton) will meet weekly with each member of the lab unless a
different agreement has been reached. I expect these meetings to be led
by the advisee, not me. These weekly meetings are a way for you to keep
me updated on your progress and to get input. I expect agendas going
into each meeting and notes written afterwards in order to make our time
together effective. This is your primary time to get my input on a
regular basis.

## Unscheduled communication

I am typically on campus from 9am-5pm Mon through Friday. However, my
time is split between being working in my office, attending meetings, or
teaching classes. When I am in my office, I may or not be available to
chat. I often have “deep work” sessions where I am trying to concentrate
and focus on thinking hard thoughts. During these times, or if I am on a
call, my door will be closed. When my door is open, you are welcome to
stop in for a quick chat. Anything longer than a few minutes may require
setting up a formal time to chat.

## Click-up

Will be introduced in January 2023.

## Lab Slack team

The lab group uses Slack <https://qmel.slack.com/> as one of our main
communication tools. It is a useful way to celebrate our achievements
together virtually, share interesting articles or papers, coordinate
collaborations, and organize meetings. This helps remove some email
clutter.

## Email

We don’t use email a lot in the lab. We use email to collaborate with
non-lab members or to share documents back and forth.

## Texting and phone calls

I use texting and phone calls sparingly. They are best for quick one
one-off messages (e.g., “For our meeting, let’s meet at the coffee shop
instead”) or in case you really need something urgently (e.g., “I’m
locked out of the building”). Conversations that require a lot of back
and forth are often handled best in a quick in-person meeting.

# Science workflow

Each scientist, lab, and field has their own set up favorite tools and
technologies that allow them to actually do science. This ranges from
what software to write papers to statistical software to field
equipment. Below is a brief description of how the scientific workflow
currently operates in the QMEL. A shared set of tools and approaches
helps us ultimately make more progress as a group.

## Programming (R, R markdown, and Github)

Our lab is a leader in open and reproducible science. This means that
every member of the lab will use tools such as R, R markdown, and
Github. These tools allow us to reproducible workflows and make our work
more accessible to others. Where possible, each paper should be written
in R markdown (and/or LaTex) and tracked using version control in
Github. Sometimes this workflow is not possible given outside
collaborators that may not be comfortable with these tools. Google docs
can work as a substitute in these cases.

## File storage and sharing

The lab uses a combination of Sharepoint and Google Drive. We use
Sharepoint for large file storage and backing up data. We use Google
drive for collaborating on documents, especially with external
co-authors. For manuscripts written by only members of QMEL, the
preference for document preparation is a combination of R markdown and
Github.

## Working on papers

The style of the lab is to share outlines and drafts of manuscripts
early and often. This allows Easton or others to make comments early on
in the process which might save a lot of headaches later. When you have
a version, you would like Easton to read, simply let him know that you
would like feedback and try to specify by when and for what you
specifically want feedback with (e.g., structuring the introduction,
figure design, etc.). Every grant and paper needs to be read by one
other lab member and Easton before submission.

## Reference manager

You are free to use whatever reference manager you prefer, but most
people in the lab use Zotero. It is free, integrates with R markdown and
Google docs, and allows collaborations among many people.

## Social media

The lab has a Twitter (<https://twitter.com/quantmarineeco>) that is
maintained by the lab PI.

# Lab website

An updated lab website (<https://quantmarineecolab.github.io/>) is
important for public engagement and sharing our work with others. As a
member of the lab, you are expected to contribute to the lab website
from time to time. This includes a biography of yourself, project
updates (usually in the form of blog posts), and posting papers. Details
of how to contribute to the website are on the website’s Github page
(<https://github.com/quantmarineecolab>).

# Authorship

For better or worse, publications are a key currency in science. They
are one of the main ways we track scientific progress and individual
production. Authorship on papers can be one of the most fraught topics
and is therefore often ignored until the last minute. This is a bad
strategy and only leads to resentment among co-authors. Therefore,
authorship (in terms of composition and order) should be determined at
the onset of the project. The specifics might change throughout the
project, but it is key to have a starting point to work with from the
start. The term “significant scientific contributions” is often used for
defining who should be included as an author. In this lab, we use the
definition from the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors
(<http://www.icmje.org/recommendations/browse/roles-and-responsibilities/defining-the-role-of-authors-and-contributors.html>):
The ICMJE recommends that authorship be based on the following 4
criteria:

-   Substantial contributions to the conception or design of the work;
    or the acquisition, analysis, or interpretation of data for the
    work; AND
-   Drafting the work or revising it critically for important
    intellectual content; AND
-   Final approval of the version to be published; AND
-   Agreement to be accountable for all aspects of the work in ensuring
    that questions related to the accuracy or integrity of any part of
    the work are appropriately investigated and resolved. In addition,
    “the corresponding author is the one individual who takes primary
    responsibility for communication with the journal during the
    manuscript submission, peer review, and publication process”.

Thus, simply providing some data or providing minor comments on a
manuscript do not warrant authorship, but they should still be
acknowledged. Just because I am your advisor, does not mean I warrant
authorship on your publications. The same goes for your committee
members. There will likely be publications that you are involved with
that I have only a small part in. That being said, the most common order
(but by no means the only) for authorship in the lab is Grad Student
Lead, Other Contributors, with the PI as the last author. It is common
for the grad student lead and the PI to both be corresponding authors.

# Funding

Like publications, funding is an important metric in science. Applying
for and receiving funding allows us to do interesting science, but it
also will help you in your career. As a lab member, you are expected to
apply for grants to support research and travel as well as fellowships
that may advance your career. This helps both you and the lab as a
whole. Although you’ll lead these applications, you can also expect
meaningful contributions from Easton throughout the process. This means
enough lead time is critical. In addition, you may occasionally be asked
to add comments or contribute a figure to a grant proposal that Easton
is working on. In addition, you are always welcome to read grants that
Easton has worked on or submitted.

As a lab, we have compiled a database of funding opportunities that are
the most relevant to members of this lab (see shared Google Drive).

# Being a successful postdoc

Postdocs (or postdoctoral fellows or postdoctoral trainees) are a
strange position within academia. It is an awkward couple of years when
you have lots of expertise, yet you are not in a permanent position.
Unlike graduate school, you are expected to be more independent,
although this depends on the lab and PI. The time as a postdoc can also
feel lonely as you are not a graduate student and also not faculty. It
is key to make connections with other postdocs or scientists on campus.
During your time as a postdoc in the QEML, you will have several
responsibilities:

1.  Working on projects/papers related to your postdoc position
2.  Finishing up old work
3.  Developing independent work
4.  Mentoring students
5.  Applying for funding and jobs

One of the most stressful parts of a postdoc position is the short-term
and finite nature of the role. You only have a couple of years to find
funding, find another postdoc position, or find a more permanent job.
This means you should be applying for opportunities throughout your time
as a postdoc.

My goal as an advisor with postdocs is to help them do good science and
get the job they want.

# Being a successful graduate student

Graduate school is designed to help make you a more independent
scientist. In the QMEL, graduate students are expected to co-develop
their projects with the lab PI as opposed to being handed a specific
project. This freedom can be GREAT, but it can also make you feel adrift
at times. That is okay and it is expected. Especially early in graduate
school, you should be spending a significant portion of your time
reading, taking classes, attending talks, and meeting others. The goal
is to think broadly and come up with interesting questions.

The goal of graduate school is not to get a degree. The goal is to learn
how to think critically, learn skills, and to get the job you want after
graduation. My goal as an advisor is to help you accomplish these
things. Early and often communication is key to a strong advisor-advisee
relationship. I have to know when you need help in order for me to be a
good advisor.

During your time as a grad student in the QEML, you will have several
responsibilities:

1.  Taking care of yourself
2.  Taking classes
3.  Attending conferences and giving presentations
4.  Working on projects/papers related to your thesis
5.  Working on projects/papers not related to your thesis
6.  Serving as a teaching assistant or teaching courses
7.  Mentoring students
8.  Applying for funding and fellowships
9.  Applying for jobs
10. Science communication and outreach
11. Staying up to date on the latest science

There is clearly a lot to being a graduate student. It can sometimes be
difficult to know where to spend your time, which is your most precious
resource. I use the term backwards design (which I’ve stolen from
research on pedagogy) to overcome this problem. The key is to think
about where you want to be after graduate school. Do you want to be a
professor? Then it will be important to publish, get funding, and teach
courses in graduate school. Do you want to work on science policy? Then
it will be important to publish, work with local officials, and apply
for opportunities related to policy. Meetings with Easton and others in
the lab or on campus will help clarify some of these choices.

In order to be successful as a scientist, it is critical that you stay
up to date on the latest research. This can be a formidable challenge
but it can be facilitated by using RSS feeds or emails with journal
table of contents. Setting up Google Scholar alerts can also be helpful
for specific key words. You can also consider following scientists or
scientific organizations on Twitter.

# Being a successful undergraduate researcher

Undergraduates play a critical role in QMEL. The lab has several ongoing
research projects led by either Professor White or another senior member
of the lab (including graduate students and postdocs). Undergraduates
interested in working in the lab should have a genuine interest in the
research questions and be interested in developing quantitative (e.g.,
math, statistics, computer programming) skills.

Research Phases: There are three phases at which undergraduates can be
involved in research within QMEL. The different phases represent
different levels of research experience, independence, and
responsibility. Most students start as research assistants. Not all
students move through all three levels of involvement.

-   Research Apprentice: The first stage of involvement for an
    undergraduate is as a research apprentice. At this stage, an
    undergraduate joins a research team in the lab. The goal is to get
    caught up on the current progress of the team. This includes reading
    scientific papers, learning necessary tools (e.g., R programming),
    and meeting regularly with team members. This phase continues until
    Professor White and the research team agree the student is ready to
    become a more active and contributing member to the lab. This phase
    typically last one semester or year.
-   Research Assistant: Following their apprenticeship, students are
    expected to contribute in more significant ways to the research
    team. This can involve collecting and analyzing data, manuscript
    writing, conducting experiments, and so forth. The goal during this
    phase is to present work at a scientific conference or submit a
    manuscript to a peer-reviewed scientific journal.
-   Research Associate: The final phase of involvement in the lab is for
    students who have presented their work at a conference or been
    involved in the submission of a manuscript (see above). This phase
    involves more leadership and independence. Students at this level
    define team goals, help mentor new team members, and meet regularly
    with Professor White. This phase in the lab is very similar to being
    a graduate student in the lab.

During your time as a undergraduate researcher in the QEML, you will
have several responsibilities:

-   Send me weekly email updates on Fridays by 5pm describing briefly
    what you’ve been working on, what you plan to do the following week,
    and any questions or troubles you had. Important things to include:
    projects you’ve worked on, broken equipment, storage/equipment
    conflicts, if your data looks weird.
-   Attend lab meetings. The entire lab assembles approximately once a
    week to discuss our research. Generally, the person leading the lab
    meeting will distribute reading materials in advance. You should
    read these materials and come prepared to participate actively in
    the discussion.
-   Maintain a lab notebook and stay organized. There is a lot of
    overlap in projects, and it is essential that you keep track of your
    work. This includes updating the data spreadsheets and lab notebooks
    immediately. Someone else should be able to step into your role at
    any moment and be able to get up to speed quickly.
-   Read background literature. A key part to your development as a
    scientist
-   Communicate, communicate, communicate. Many of the issues that arise
    in research are simply because of a lack of communication. It is
    critical that you communicate early and often on issues or concerns
    that you may be experiences.
-   Be independent. I am periodically away, and I expect you to get
    things done well without me. Ask questions when I am around, but
    don’t be afraid to try to do the detective work on your own if I am
    not. We have a helpful, experienced lab, so know that folks other
    than me may be excellent resources.
-   Keep up with your other responsibilities. As an undergraduate, you
    have many other obligations. This can include coursework, jobs,
    family, and more.

# Lab offboarding

We have a document in the shared Google drive focused on lab
offboarding, the process that describes what happens when someone leaves
the lab. Here is a brief summary of the process.

-   Ensure that all data (including raw data sheets) and code is
    available in a public repository or in the QuantMarineEcoLab Github,
    GoogleDrive, or Sharepoint folders
-   Ensure that your data (if applicable) has appropriate metadata
    (e.g., describing columns in your data)
    <https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/about>
-   Develop a plan for next steps (if appropriate) for your project in
    collaboration with your mentor and Easton
-   Return any lab equipment (e.g., books, computer accessories, field
    equipment)
-   Return office keys to Easton or the department
-   Complete a progress assessment form
    <https://unh.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_8B3OVWv6ZvPofcy>
-   Compile a list (of activities during your time in the lab) of all
    your grants awarded, publications submitted and accepted, classes
    taught, and outreach activities (this can be take from your previous
    progress updates)
-   Set up an exit interview with your direct mentor and/or Easton
