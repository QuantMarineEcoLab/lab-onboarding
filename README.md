# QMEL Lab Onboarding 

Welcome to the Quantitative Marine Ecology Lab! This Github repository contains both a [lab manual (i.e., onboarding document)](https://github.com/QuantMarineEcoLab/lab-onboarding/blob/main/qmel-onboarding.md) and a [lab wiki](https://github.com/QuantMarineEcoLab/lab-onboarding/wiki). The lab manual sets the general lab expectations and processes. The lab wiki is more dynamic with nitty gritty details regarding how specific things function in the lab. There is a seperate [website wiki](https://github.com/QuantMarineEcoLab/quantmarineecolab.github.io/wiki) with information on how to make edits to the lab website (e.g., add a profile page, add a blog post). 

Both the lab manual and lab wiki are living documents. You are encouraged to make comments and suggestions to both. You can already make changes to the lab wiki directly. For the lab manual, you can `fork` the document to your own Github account, make changes, and then submit a pull request. These steps will make more sense once you've become familiar with version control and Github. 

In addition to the lab manual, all lab members should verify they have completed the following lab onboarding steps:

- Request access to the QMEL Google Drive and Sharepoint folders
- Request to join the lab Slack group. This may also involve joining the Department of Biological Sciences Slack group
- Join related listserves (links TBD)
- If needed, submit I-9 paperwork and direct deposit paperwork
- Add or update your biography on the lab website
- Obtain keys from Lisa for both your personal office and the lab space
